## Version 3.1.3

[Link to this release.](https://github.com/vyrjana/pyimpspec/releases/tag/3.1.3)

- Added support for `kvxopt` as an optional dependency as a drop-in replacement for `cvxopt`.
- Updated how import errors related to the convex optimizers required by the TR-RBF method (DRT analysis) are handled, which should allow the rest of pyimpspec to function even if no convex optimizers can be imported successfully.
